            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>What is Disc Golf? Disc Golf was invented in 1927 throwing tin lids into 4 ft wide circles drawn into sandy patches on school grounds in Canada. Since then it has evolved into
                throwing plastic discs, each with a different mold to allow for different flights. The goal, similar to regular golf, is to get from the start to a chain link basket is the least
                amount of throws possible.</p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <h3>Some basic rules to get you started:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="rule">Your starting throw must be from the tee pad. As long and your plant foot is on the semect when the disc leaves your hand you are good.</li>
                    <li class="rule">Your lie is either the point of your disc farthest from the basket OR you may place a mini on the side closest to the basket and then move your disc. Then the back of the mini becomes your lie.</li>
                    <li class="rule">Every other throw one point of support, usually plant foot, must be from within a paper sized rectangle behind your lie. Your lie must be the closest thing to the basket when the disc leaves your hand.</li>
                    <li class="rule">If you throw out of bounds or in a spot secified by the course as an obstruction, unless the course states otherwise, put your lie upt to 3 ft in any direction from where the disc last crossed in-bounds.</li>
                    <li class="rule">If you move your lie away from out of bounds but your disc didn't land OB, you may only move it perpendicular from the line. Otherwise, so matter how rough the area is you play it where it lies</li>
                    <li class="rule">You can't end with any suportive points in front of your lie if within 33 ft of the basket, otherwise as long as the disc have left your hand you may continue forward.</li>
                    <li class="rule">Be courteous of other players, be quiet and ideally not in their vision while they throw unless warning them about other players or pedestrians in the way.</li>
                    <li class="rule">Most courses are public parks and pedestrians have the right of way. Patiently wait until they are out of range before throwing.</li>
                    <li class="rule">Have Fun! Don't be overbearing and don't be afraid to ask questions.</li>
                </ul>
