        Fun fact to start out: I just got engaged over the break 
        which is very exciting!
        I'm currently in computer science but there is a 
        potential switch to software engineering in my future. 
        My hobbies include disc golf, ping pong, pickle ball, 
        and ultimate frisbee.

        My favorite hymn is "Master the Tempest is Raging", as it dictates
        a struggle through trials and the subsequent saving and freeing from it.
        The line saying "I perish I parish dear Master, oh hasten and take control"
        hits me hard everytime I hear it because I've felt that anguish of spirit, and
        I too was met with our Savior healing me and saying "Peace, peace, be still" 
        along with the promise that as I keep Him by my side nothing can rock our boat.

        My favorite scripture right now is from a similar period in which Jesus walks
        on the water before His disciples and Peter asks and attempts to walk out to
        Him on the water. Through a recent conference talk I realized that when Jesus
        was saying oh ye of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt, He was saying
        something like: "Peter, you were doing so good. You took action and stepped onto
        the water. You were almost too me and then you doubted yourself. If you could
        see yourself through my eyes all that doubt would be dispelled. Have more faith
        in yourself."
